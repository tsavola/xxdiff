DETAILS OF THE QT4 PATCH

The patch is taken against the 960 revision of xxdiff and assumes that the
qt4prep.patch has already been applied.

To apply this patch, you must first switch to the src directory and run this
command:

  qt3to4 xxdiff.pro

When prompted, tell the utility to convert all files. This will modify the
source code to use the Qt3Support API in the places where it is necessary.

You should then be able to apply the patch in the conventional way.

Note that I'm unsure about the validity of some of the changes I made,
particularly w.r.t. the writeRawBytes/readRawBytes modifications. I may have
introduced some bugs.

I also punted by simply removing the entire XxCopyLabel::Tip functionality. It
seems that tooltips have been completely redesigned in Qt4, and it would have
taken me too much time to figure out how to port the tooltip code to Qt4.

You will also need to patch the generated file resParser_lex.cpp. To do so, go
to line 808 and change this:

    input_stream_ptr->readRawBytes( &buf[ii], 1 ); \

to this:

    (*input_stream_ptr) >> buf[ii]; \

Again, I'm not 100% sure that this is correct, but it seems to be right (and it
compiles, at least).
