====================
In-Core Diff Patches
====================

This directory contains patches to be applied to specific versions of GNU diff
or other diffs with available source code, so that we can compile xxdiff
in-core. The reason is that we wanted at some point to not have to spawn an
externel GNU diff, especially under Windows.

We never completed this task but had some success binding directly to GNU diff
at some point.  However, it was never maintained nor shipped as a working
feature.  Nevertheless, we keep patches here in case we ever want to revive this
idea.
